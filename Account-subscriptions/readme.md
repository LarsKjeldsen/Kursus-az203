```
Check the dollar balance of you Azure Pass within Microsoft Azure once you have set up your subscription, and be aware of how much you are consuming as you proceed through the labs

Do not allow Microsoft Azure components to run overnight or for extended periods. Scripts are run at the end of each lab to remove unneeded services in Azure to prevent unnecessary charges against the subscription.

Remove any Microsoft Azureâ€“created components or services such as storage, virtual machines, or cloud services, after you finish your lab to help minimize cost usage and extend the life of your Microsoft Learning Azure Pass. Scripts are run at the end of each lab to remove unneeded services in Azure to prevent unnecessary charges against the subscription.
